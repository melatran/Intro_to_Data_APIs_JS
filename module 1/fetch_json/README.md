# Fetch JSON

**JSON:** JavaScript Notation

- getting data from an external API

- [Where the ISS At](https://wheretheiss.at/)

    - this API gives the current position of the space station

    - only want the lat and lon to display on the page

    - no authentication required

- also use Leaflet library to map

- JSON similar to JS object

```
let pos = {
    lat: -45
    lon: 122
};
```
